# Hello-World
My first repository....EVER

I'm quite new to coding and after about a month and a half, I'm still learning how to use CSS properly and the "basics" I know about jQuery are actually, "pre-basic".

Anyway, I decided to join the awesome world of coding and developing (About time, DAMMIT!!) and will do the best I can to contribute and, of course, have fun with this.
